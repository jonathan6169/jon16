   <p>Since being drafted 1st overall back in 2003 Lebron James has been the 
   most dominant player in the league. During the 2015-16 season even though 
   Lebron had his lowest scoring season since his rookie season he still produced
   all around amazing numbers, most of his averages were either on par or above 
   his career averages. Lebron has been the heart and soul of the Cleveland
   Cavaliers, not only has he played like a all star but he has taken them to back
   to back finals. Aside from personal accolades Lebron has made history this year
   he led his team to the NBA finals but fell on a 3-1 deficit but being the all star
   he is he led his team to a championship and overcame a 3-1 deficit which was the
   first in NBA history.</p>

<div class="curry">
<p>Curry has proved himself to be one of the best shooters in NBA history if not
the best, he has been one of the most efficient scorers this past season by scoring
over 50% of his total points from the 3 point line. This ability to shoot from distance
has led to Curry killing teams on the offensive end because not many players are able
to contain him while he gets hot. Last season Curry not only won the first unanimous
MVP in NBA history, set an NBA record for most 3's made in a season with
402 made 3's shattering his previous record but he also led his team to a record breaking
73-9 season. Curry is placed number 2 largely due to the fact that during the NBA
Finals Curry couldn't lead his team to a championship, he fell to Lebron's Cleveland
Cavaliers. Thus earning Curry the number 2 spot.</p>

   <p>Russell Westbrook has been one of the most dominant players in recent NBA history
   not many players are able to defend, score, rebound and assist quite like Westbrook
   he is an all around superstar. In the game of basketball a triple-double which is
   having double digits in the 3 major statistical categories, points, assists, and
   rebounds is a rare achievement few players have been able to accomplish this feat
   more than a few times. But unlike those players Russell Westbrook achieved this feat
   18 times in the 2015-16 season which proves how much of an overall superstar he is.
   This is specially amazing because Westbrook played on a team that featured the
   MVP of the 2013-14 season, Kevin Durant who is a proven scorer, so this means they
   have to share the load of work, but Westbrook still found a way to shine.</p>

<p>Although Kawhi Leonard isn't the flashiest player, he's not making the flashiest
passes, or the fancy dunks but he is an effective all around player. Kawhi has been
an amazing leader for his team doing it all and whatever it takes to win games and
make it far in the playoffs. However in his game it isn't his offense that makes him standout
it's his defense, he's been an amazing defender being able to guard anyone he is put up
against. He is currently the recipient of the Defensive Player of The Year which means
the NBA recognizes how hard Kawhi works to shut down any player. He is also an effective
scorer he shoots over 50% and is able to blow by defenders using his quickness and
strength to muscle his way past them.</p>

<p>Kevin Durant has proved himself to be one of the best scorers in the NBA he is one
of the few players that can drop 30+ points on any given night. Not only can he score
at will Durant shot a stunning 50% from the field this means that for every shot that
he misses he hits one, this makes him one of the most effective scorers in the league.
Durant was half of the duo that led Oklahoma to the NBA Conference Finals, along side
Russell Westbrook they almost took down the Warriors but ultimately fell to them in
7 games. Even though Durant couldn't pull the Thunder to the finals he still proved
himself to be an elite scorer.</p>
